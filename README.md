# Legion Tactical Mission Framework #

Based on F3 Mission Framework Version 3.3.0


## INSTALLATION ##

To begin using the Software, move the LTMF.Altis folder into one of the following directories:

* \My Documents\Arma 3\MPMissions\
* \My Documents\Arma 3 Other Profiles\YourPlayerName\MPMissions\


## USAGE ##

As this is based on F3, you can use the F3 documentation, which is far better that anything I could be bothered to write.
